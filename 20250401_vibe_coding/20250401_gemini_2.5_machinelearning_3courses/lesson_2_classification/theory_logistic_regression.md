# Lesson 2: Intermediate Machine Learning - Classification with Logistic Regression

## Theory

### What is Classification?
- Difference between Regression and Classification.
- Types of Classification problems (Binary, Multiclass).

### Logistic Regression
- Concept: Modeling probability using the sigmoid function.
- Sigmoid Function (Logistic Function).
- Decision Boundary.
- Cost Function (Log Loss / Binary Cross-Entropy).
- Gradient Descent for Logistic Regression (Optional).
- Evaluation Metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve).

## Use Cases
Examples where Logistic Regression is applied (e.g., spam detection, medical diagnosis).

## Comparison
Brief comparison with other classification algorithms (e.g., KNN, SVM - to be covered later or as alternatives).
